## Why be productive?

If you're asking yourself the question, "why should I even bother being productive?", then this blog is a great place to start. The fact that you ended up on here reading this is already an indication of your interest. Here are a couple of good reasons to improve your productivity.

1. **Self-improvement** - This one is my favorite. Becoming the best version of ourselves is something we should all aspire to do. It's a no-brainer, practice makes perfect.
2. **Mental health** -  You know that feeling you get when you get through all your work, come back from a run or mow the lawn? It's a feeling of accomplishment and it improves your mood. If you enjoy that feeling, what's stopping you from feeling it more often?
3. **Success** - This one is a little subjective. Everyone's idea of success is different. One can measure success in money, family time or fitness. Whatever it is for you, being more productive will make you more successful. 

## Getting Started
Great, you pinned down the reason for trying to become more productive. Now you're either thinking, "Okay but where do I find the time for all of the things I want to do?" or, "I don't even know what I want to do with my time". I will break this section down into two parts to tackle both of these thoughts.

### Time management

If you have poor time management skills then this section is for you. I understand that everyone's schedule is different. You might think that you simply do not have any spare time, but chances are you might not be utilizing it correctly. Here are some tips that will help you manage your time better.

1. **Sleep** - Early bird gets the worm. If you enjoy a nice lie-in on the weekends or ten-minute naps that turn into a three-hour slumber, then you might want to fix your sleeping patterns. Ther's nothing wrong with having a good rest after a long week of hard work but a lot of time can be freed up if you can get a little earlier. I suggest finding an appropriate amount of hours of sleep. Adults need between 7-9 hours of sleep so find what works for you and don't over-sleep.
2. **Make a schedule** - Time flies when you don't track it. Identify potential time-gaps in your day. This is different for everyone, it could be a couple of hours in the morning for some and a full day for others. Create a schedule and fill it with tasks you want to accomplish. Try to set a realistic time-frame for each task and schedule them for certain parts of the day. It can be as simple as a piece of paper but I would recommend using a scheduling app on your phone or even the calendar app, there are tonnes of them. Remember not to overload your schedule, being productive should be enjoyable, not a chore.
3. **Eliminate time-wasters** - Remember, this is your self-improvement journey. You decide what is a waste of time in your life. Nobody can make those decisions for you. In my case, I seriously cut down on video games and Netflix. I realized that games are a great way of rewarding myself for being productive but contribute very little to self-improvement. Decide for yourself, eliminate some time-wasters.

### Findings things to do

This section is for those who have plenty of spare time but find themselves wandering around, scrolling through feeds and watching cat videos for hours. Before I became productive, video games were my biggest time-waster. Don't get me wrong, I still play video games because I love them but they can be a major nemesis of productivity. Here are some tips on how to find things to do in your spare time to get productive.

1. **Get interested** - When you come across something that draws your attention, get interested in it and start googling. This might seem like something obvious but it is something that I do often. Getting interested in something can turn into a potential hobby or a job!
2. **Hobbies** - Whether you have one or not, a hobby is possibly your best starting point. Find something that you enjoy, do it consistently and get good at it. 
3. **Community** - A friendly and helpful community can turn your tasks from painful to enjoyable. Let's say you are trying to get good at photoshop. You might come across a bunch of issues with the software or you need some opinions on your work. Look for an online community where you can ask questions and show off your projects! Being part of an entire community that enjoys the same thing as you do, pushes you to improve and stay consistent.
4. **Work/Study** - If you are a professional or a student, you should have plenty of opportunities to get more productive. Get good at what you are doing. Research topics from your day-to-day work or lectures and improve. Becoming skilled in your profession should always be a priority. One tip though, pin-point specific topics and work on them separately to prevent overloading your schedule, as mentioned previously.

## Wrapping up
I think that your road to productivity always begins in your head. If you read this entire blog or parts of it, it is already an indication of your interest and a good sign. Becoming productive can be a challenge as there are many distractions around us and often, not many rewards. Remember your productivity should always bring you a sense of accomplishment and that should be enough to get you started! 

I hope that this blog could be a starting point for some of you. I know that there is much more to cover here but this blog is supposed to serve as a general starting point. I will be covering these topics in more detail in future blogs!
